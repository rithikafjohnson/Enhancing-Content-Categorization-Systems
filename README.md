# Enhancing-Content-Categorization-Systems-A-Comparative-Study-of-Integrated-Diverse-Datasets-
 Revolutionizing personalized news categorization with LaMP architecture. Integrating diverse datasets, including AG News and Book Depository, enhances adaptability.

 This study presents an innovative methodology for achieving personalized news categorization through strategic utilization of the LaMP architecture. Rigorous data preprocessing, encompassing a new personalization dataset and integration of established datasets (AG News and Book Depository), yields a comprehensive dataset, enriching the model's adaptability across diverse content domains. The methodology's essence lies in the integration of varied datasets, providing a holistic user preference perspective. Combining LaMP with the BM25 algorithm ensures the construction of personalized prompts that encapsulate nuanced user preferences. This approach establishes a foundation for precise content category predictions by the Flan-T5-base-finetuned model. The finetuning process, employing generated prompts post-retrieval, refines the language model's capacity to accurately discern and predict content categories. Through a comparative analysis across diverse integration scenarios, the research elucidates the advancements fostered by the LaMP architecture in personalized news categorization. In summary, this study formulates a robust methodology for personalized news categorization, offering insights into the intricate interplay among diverse datasets, retrieval algorithms, and language models. This scholarly contribution significantly propels the evolution of tailored content recommendation systems, promising more effective and personalized user experiences.
